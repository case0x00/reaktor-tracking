# mission 003

when you stride through the sleepy bazaar of Kungrad, Uzbekistan. Discreetly scanning this modest oasis in the rocky Central Asian desert, it takes you a good couple of curious glances from older salesladies to spot the tiny man in the back. His weather-beaten trailer is bending under the weight of dozens of plump cabbages.

The man is setting up an equally exhausted looking camping chair when he suddenly senses your stare. Expressionless, he holds your gaze while you walk over.

A: "I hear the pipeline running under the village was repaired today."

B: "Yes, yes…gave the villagers a scare, those leaks. Came real close to an explosion – one more slip, and this town would have been done with."

A:  "You’re welcome, Professor. You must know why I’m here. Why did Unnamed want your life?"

B: "I figured it out. Why they’ve been taking all those diamond ships. To fund its development."

A: "Fund what development, exactly?"

B: "They have engineered a new kind of bioweapon, a fungus, really. One that kills and eats up all vegetation it touches. Soon, all of the world’s flora, everything that keeps us breathing, will be gone."

A: "Dear god."

B: "You haven’t even heard the worst part. They have already started spreading it. The first target is the world’s lungs, of course. Amazon rainforest."

To uncover where Unnamed has started spreading the vile fungus, you need to find out where trees have been dying. When too many trees are removed in a short period, soil erosion increases quickly, causing water to pool.

While flood danger varies slightly day-to-day through natural geological activity, a one-day change in excess on 1,000m3 is virtually always suspicious.

Using satellite data, you have identified 50 regions of forest where something fishy has been going on, and monitored soil levels in those regions for the past month. Your last mission is to analyze the soil levels to find suspicious one-day changes in flood danger and help exterminate the bioweapon.

## this is not technically complete

I found two days with anomalous increases in area, but the website doesnt mention the formatting of the password at all. it cant decode from hex, so maybe the days I found aren't correct but I have no idea what went wrong then since it all seems to check out. I don't know how many days or if its just one day, or how to represent that given day in the form of a password. I've included the images, where 2FEA2A-F and E0EB59-M are the suspicious one day changes. but M isnt hexadecimal, so maybe its wrong. regardless it was interesting, but the solution they wanted to the puzzle was poorly explained. It should mention the password length and if it must be decoded (b64, hex, etc) since why would you not state that? that isn't the core of the puzzle and it makes verifying a solution frustrating.

I'm pretty proud of how I managed to compute the areas. It isnt perfect, since sometimes a peak can cut between a pool and mess up the results but apart from that its solid. I might email them to try and figure something out. maybe they arent actually single day peaks because if you look at the daily areas, it increases and stays near that level for the rest of the month.
